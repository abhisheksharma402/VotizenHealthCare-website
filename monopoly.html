            <h2>What is a Franchised Monopoly?</h3>
            <p>A franchised monopoly is status given by the government to a company or individual. A monopoly refers to a situation where a given sector or industry is dominated by one firm, entity or corporation which has become large enough to own all or nearly all of the market for a particular type of product or service. A franchised monopoly is sheltered from competition by virtue of an exclusive license or patent granted to it by the government.</p>
            <p>Government-issued franchised monopolies are typically established because they are believed to be the best option for supplying a good or service from the perspective of both the producers and the consumers of that good or service. Given government intervention and sometimes outright subsidies, franchised monopolies allow producers to operate in markets where they must sink considerable sums of capital to produce a good or service. Likewise, since governments that grant monopolies often regulate the price that can be charged by the supplier of the good or service, consumers gain access to a good or service that in a free market may be unaffordable.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Under mercantilist economic systems, European governments with colonial interests often granted large and extremely lucrative monopolies to companies trading in particular regions, such as the Dutch East India Company.

            Today, government-granted monopolies may be found in public utility services such as public roads, mail, water supply, and electric power, as well as certain specialized and highly regulated fields such as education and gambling. In many countries lucrative natural resources industries, especially the petroleum industry, are controlled by government-granted monopolies. Franchises granted by governments to operate public transit through public roads are another example</p>
             <h3>Patent</h3>
              <p>A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a state or national government to an inventor or his/her assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for a public disclosure of an invention.

            The procedure for granting patents, the requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims defining the invention which must be new, inventive, and useful or industrially applicable. In many countries, certain subject areas are excluded from patents, such as business methods and mental acts. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission.</p>
            <h3>Trademark</h3>
            <p>A <a href="about.html"style="color:#F5B041 ;"> trademark or trade mark</a> is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, business organization, or other legal entity to identify that the products or services to consumers with which the trademark appears originate from a unique source, and to distinguish its products or services from those of other entities.

          Trademarks can act as a form of consumer protection that lowers the transaction costs between a buyer and seller who are not personally acquainted.</p>
